Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Is the engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain software systems.
It is important since helps us develop systems and software applications that power various aspects of life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Development of programming languages such as C++. This languages enables us to communicate with computers effectively.
2. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s. Software engineering was created to solve problems when building comlicated software.
3. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s. Structured programming helps organize code in a clear and logical way.
4. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s. Agile methods focus on quick, flexible, and customer-focused software development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements- collecting and documenting the needs of the consumer and the system requirements.
2. Design- Creating a complex and detailed designs of a software architecture and consumer interface.
3. Implementation- Writing the code and building the software according to the requirements.
4. Testing- Running a number of tests to ensure the software meets the requirements.
5. Deployment- Releasing the software to consumers.
6. Maintenance: Continuously updating, and enhancing the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall is a stepwise approach with different phases.
- Agile is an iterative and incremental approach focusing on collaboration, flexibility, and responding to changes based on user feedback.
- waterfall can be used in building a House. You start with the foundation, then the walls, and roof stepwise.
- Agile can be used in developing a Video Game. The game features changes regularly based on user feedbacks and requirements.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software developer writes the code and implements software solutions.
- Quality assurance engineer designs and executes test plans to ensure a high quality of the software.
- Project manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivering of software projects.
  
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- IDEs combine coding tools in one place, making development faster and more efficient e.g Visual Studio Code
- VCS tracks changes to code, allowing many developers to work together efficiently and access previous versions when needed e.g Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Complex Codebases- Large and complicated projects.
   - Strategy- Break down the project into smaller, simple and manageable tasks.
2. Tight Deadlines- Delivering quality software under short time.
   - Strategy- Prioritize tasks, focus on core features first.
3. Keeping Up with Technology- Rapid changes in programming languages, tools, and frameworks.
   - Strategy- Learning continuously.
4. Debugging and Fixing Bugs- Tracking down and resolving errors.
   - Strategy- Use systematic testing, debugging tools to catch issues early.
5. Collaboration and Communication- Misunderstandings between team members.
   - Strategy- Practice clear, regular communication.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering the development of precise instructions that you will input into AI models to get a desired output. It helps AI models to understand and execute the desired task effectively.

Vague Prompt- Generate a report.

Improved Prompt- Generate a report in Excel with sales data for the last month, showing total sales and most sold products.

The improved prompt is clear because it specifies the format (Excel) and the content (sales data, total sales, most sold products).
This helps the AI to narrow down to specific demand saving time.
